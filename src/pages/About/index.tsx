                            Growing up, I had no clear picture of the future I was working toward. I just knew it would be something that would inspire and challenge me, while also bringing a sense of stability, fulfillment and joy.<br /><br />
                            I first discovered computer science in high school through a summer program at MIT. It was toughâ€”I had never experienced such academic rigor. But by proactively seeking support, I persevered.</p>

                            For undergrad, I attended Columbia University's School of Engineering. I majored in Computer Science with a focus on applications.

                            As a first-generation college student, I struggled navigating higher education. With the support of friends, family, and my Columbia community, I gained the confidence to embrace difficult challenges and push forward.</p>
